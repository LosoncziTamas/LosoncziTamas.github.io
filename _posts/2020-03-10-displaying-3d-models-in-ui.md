1. Create a canvas using the default settings (Screen Space - Overlay). 
2. Add a camera to the hierarchy which is going to look at the 3D models.
   * Make sure to set-up the clipping panes properly, so the models are visible and nothing else obscures the view.
3. Position the 3D models/camera/lights to have the desired look & feel.
4. Create a Render Texture and set the camera's Target Texture to it.
5. Add a RawImage to the Canvas and set the RawImage's Texture to the Render Texture.
