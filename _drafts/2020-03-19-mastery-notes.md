## Introduction:
- The quick - fix , fast - temporary - relief , bottom - line mentality doesn’t work in the long run , and is eventually destructive to the individual and the society. If there is any sure route to success and fulfillment in life, it is to be found in the long - term , essentially goalless process of mastery.
- There are distinctive patterns the author recognized in the students in his aikido school: dabbler, the obsessive, and the hacker.
- It wasn’t necessarily the most talented who would persevere on the long road to black belt and beyond.

## The masters journey:
- What is mastery?
    - Resists definition, yet can be instantly recognized. Comes in many varieties, yet follows certain unchanging laws.
    - Brings rich rewards, yet is not really a goal or a destination but rather a process, a journey. We call this journey mastery, and tend to assume that it requires a special ticket available only to those born with exceptional abilities.
    - Unfortunately, in our modern world, we’re continually bombarded with promises of immediate gratification, instant success, and fast, temporary relief, all of which lead in exactly the wrong direction.
    - All of us who are born without serious genetic defects are born geniuses (ex.: we can master the overarching symbolic system of spoken language, even without formal schooling we can make associations and create abstract categories, construt meaningful hierarchies).
    - Intelligence comes in many forms (linguistic, musical, logical/mathematical, spatial, bodily/kinesthetic, and two types of personal intelligences (intrapersonal and interpersonal)).
    - We are not only geniuses in terms of thought and feeling, but in the potentia of the body.
    - But genius, no matter how bright, will come to naught or swiftly burn out if you don’t choose the master’s journey. It's a long path and has a characteristic rhythm like this (mastery curve):
- The mastery curve
    - To take the master’s journey, you have to practice diligently, keep practicing even when you seem to be getting nowhere. 
    - Why does learning take place in spurts? Why can’t we make steady upward progress on our way toward mastery?
      - There is something called “habitual behavior system” that operates deeper then our conscious thoughts.  This system allows us to do things without worrying about how to do them. However, when you start to learn new skill you have to think about it.
      - In order to reprogram this system you have to make conscious efforts and build a habit.
      - Learning generally occurs in stages. A stage ends when the habitual system has been programmed to the new task.
How do you best move toward mastery? To put it simply, you practice diligently, but you practice primarily for the sake of the practice itself. Rather than being frustrated while on the plateau, you learn to appreciate and enjoy it just as much as you do the upward surges.
