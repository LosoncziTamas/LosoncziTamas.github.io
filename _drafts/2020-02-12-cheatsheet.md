__Scenario 1:__ Move `objectA` around `objectB`

```
    public class MoveAround : MonoBehaviour
    {
        public GameObject gameObjectB;
        
        private Vector3 _offset;

        private void Start()
        {
            // Offset between two objects
            _offset = gameObjectB.transform.position - transform.position;
        }

        private void Update()
        {
            var translation = new Vector3();
            transform.Translate(translation);
        }
    }
```

__Scenario 2:__ Rotate `objectA` around itself

```

```

__Scenario 3:__ Make `objectA` face toward `direction`

```

```
