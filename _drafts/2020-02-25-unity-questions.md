### Input
------
__Q__: What is the difference between `Input.GetAxis(string axisName)` and `Input.GetAxisRaw(string axisName)`?  
__A__: `Input.GetAxis(string axisName)` returns a smoothed value, which means the value will be in a range of [-1, 1] (except when the axis is setup to be delta mouse movement). On the other hand, `Input.GetAxisRaw(string axisName)` returns a "raw" value which is either -1, 0 or 1.


__Q__: What change should I make in a project to make the following code run without errors: `Input.GetAxis("foo")`?  
__A__: Add a new axis named "foo" under Project Settings/Input.

__Q__: Can you affect the smoothing of the value returned by `Input.GetAxis(string axisName)`?  
__A__: Yes, smoothing depends on the axis parameters set in the Input settings.

### Interaction
---

__Q__: What are the required steps to make a user gesture (ex.: touch) interact with an object in the virtual world? For example, selecting an object in a 3D scene by screen tapping.  
__A__: First, you'll need to detect the position of the tap in screen space: `GetTouch(int index)`. Then you'll need to determine whether the tap overlaps the object in the scene. In 3D this is done by performing raycasting from the camera:
```
    var ray = Camera.main.ScreenPointToRay(new Vector3(screenPosition.x, screenPosition.y, 0f));
    if (Physics.Raycast(ray, out var hit))
    {
        // Hit found
    }
```
You can get a reference to the transform of the object via the `RaycastHit` structure which then can be used to indicate the selection (ex.: scaling up).

### Rendering
---

__Q__: What are the 4 coordinate systems in Unity? What are the differences between them?  
__A__: Screen coordinates, GUI coordinates, Viewport coordinates and World coordinates.

__Q__: How do you convert from one to the other?  
__A__: 

__Q__: What is the relationship between a Mesh Filter and Mesh Renderer?  
__A__: A Mesh Filter holds information about the mesh instance. A Mesh Renderer does the actual rendering by using a Mesh Filter.
